# FSND-capstone
Heroku URL: https://fsnd-capstone-clamont.herokuapp.com/

## Getting started
### Installing dependencies
This project requires Python and pip. Once these are available, the dependencies can all be installed in an virtual environment by running:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once the dependencies are installed, the database can be set up with
```bash
createdb capstone
flask db upgrade
```
---
### Running Tests
This project comes with a unittest suite which covers all the basic endpoints and errors. To run the tests, after installing the dependencies:
1. Open [test.sh](./test.sh) in your editor, and update the ```USERNAME:PASSWORD``` to match your postgres setup
2. Execute ```sh ./test.sh```

The required JWT's are also stored in [test.sh](./test.sh).

Additionally, the API can be tested in postman using [capstone-tests-full.postman_collection.json](the supplied collection).

---
### Running the server 
There is a bash script included to start the server. To use, edit the POSTGRES_USERNAME and POSTGRES_PASSWORD values in ```setup.sh``` and run:
```bash
    sh ./setup.sh
```

Note that this starts the server in development mode.

## Roles and authentication

All user accounts and roles are enforced using Auth0 for RBAC. There are three roles:

* *Casting Assistant* - can view actors and movies only
* *Casting Director* - can add and delete actors
* *Executive Producer* - can add and delete movies 

A JWT token can be generated by logging in [here](https://udac-capstone.eu.auth0.com/authorize?audience=fsnd-auth&response_type=token&client_id=9PBdGhtlOfPeSVAZQxFTWTils3RgbWdb&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080/login-results)
